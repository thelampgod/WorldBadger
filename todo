Datamining program for 1.13+ (focus on whatever version 2b2t is on)
Inspo DaMatrix/SaveSearcher

Use Querz/Nbt (version 7) for reading mca's
Features needed:
for all: with optional limits by y, outputs by default the coordinates of the match to file of the same name as the module
* Sign search module
 - clean output mode without json
 - raw output mode
 - can search for specific string to only extract those signs

* BlockEntity search module
 - optionally by blockentity type
 - option to output full raw nbt.

* Entity search module
 - optionally by entity type
 - option for tamed only
 - option for converting owner-uuid to username using mojang api
 - output useful info by default (customname, health)
 - option to output full raw nbt

* Block search module
 - specify block type and optionally meta
pre-requisite: chunk sections abstracted away from palette, want something like chunk.getBlockAt(x,y,z) but should still skip
 the entire section if its a singlevaluepaletted section (like if searching for water and finding a singlevaluepalleted section of water,
  add all coords of the section to output from only the first check of the section, don't check every coord of the section.)

* Item search module
 - search for items inside of block entities and entity inventories (item frames, donkey/boat chests etc.)
 - premade book item searcher with special formatting
 - premade map item searcher with option for image generation

* Version-guesser module - not full on chunkversionchecker, only using block types in chunks to guess version:
need to specify dimension
